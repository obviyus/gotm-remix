# Engineering Conventions

## Conventions

When writing code, follow these conventions to ensure consistency and readability:
- White simple, maintainable code, always prefer simplicity over cleverness
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Avoid over-using abstractions
- Use `mysql2` for all database operations

## Directory Structure

- `db/schema.sql`: Contains the database schema
- `src/`: Contains all Remix source code
- `src/routes/`: Contains all Remix routes
- `src/components/`: Contains all React components used in the project
- `src/utils/`: Miscellaneous utility functions
